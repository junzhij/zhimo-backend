# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ZhiMo backend system is a multi-agent AI-powered platform designed to help students efficiently process, analyze, and synthesize academic materials. The system transforms raw learning materials (PDFs, PPTs, images, etc.) into structured knowledge elements and personalized study materials through a coordinated team of specialized AI agents.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to upload various types of academic materials (PDF, Word, PPT, images, web links), so that I can have all my study resources centrally managed and processed by AI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a PDF file THEN the system SHALL store it in S3 and create a document record with processing status "pending"
2. WHEN a user uploads a Word document THEN the system SHALL extract text content and store both original file and extracted content
3. WHEN a user uploads an image file THEN the system SHALL apply OCR to extract text content
4. WHEN a user provides a web link THEN the system SHALL crawl and extract the main content
5. WHEN file upload is complete THEN the system SHALL update document status to "ready_for_processing"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want the AI system to automatically analyze my uploaded materials and extract key knowledge elements, so that I can quickly access structured information without reading through entire documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is ready for processing THEN the Orchestrator Agent SHALL coordinate analysis workflow
2. WHEN the Ingestion Agent processes a document THEN it SHALL produce standardized JSON text structure
3. WHEN the Analysis Agent processes structured text THEN it SHALL generate summaries, topic models, and structural analysis
4. WHEN the Knowledge Extraction Agent processes text THEN it SHALL identify entities, definitions, formulas, and relationships
5. WHEN processing is complete THEN all knowledge elements SHALL be stored with references to source documents

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want to create personalized annotations and highlights on digital materials, so that I can capture my own thoughts and insights alongside AI-generated content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user highlights text in a document THEN the system SHALL store the annotation with precise location reference
2. WHEN a user adds a personal note THEN it SHALL be linked to the specific document section
3. WHEN a user marks important sections THEN the system SHALL preserve the markup for later retrieval
4. WHEN annotations are created THEN they SHALL be searchable and filterable by document or topic

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want to generate custom study materials (flashcards, Q&A, practice tests) from my processed content, so that I can create effective review materials tailored to my learning needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests flashcards THEN the Pedagogy Agent SHALL generate cards from extracted definitions and concepts
2. WHEN a user requests practice questions THEN the system SHALL create multiple choice, fill-in-blank, and short answer questions
3. WHEN a user requests open-ended questions THEN the system SHALL generate thought-provoking questions based on content themes
4. WHEN study materials are generated THEN they SHALL reference source requirements and be stored for reuse

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student, I want to compile selected knowledge elements and personal notes into custom study notebooks, so that I can create comprehensive review materials for specific subjects or exams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new notebook THEN the system SHALL allow selection of knowledge elements and annotations
2. WHEN a user arranges notebook content THEN the system SHALL preserve the specified order and organization
3. WHEN a user requests PDF export THEN the Synthesis Agent SHALL generate professionally formatted output
4. WHEN notebooks are created THEN they SHALL be saveable, editable, and shareable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the multi-agent system to coordinate efficiently and handle failures gracefully, so that the platform remains reliable and responsive under various load conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent receives a task THEN it SHALL acknowledge receipt and provide status updates
2. WHEN an agent fails to complete a task THEN the Orchestrator SHALL implement retry logic or error handling
3. WHEN multiple agents work in parallel THEN the system SHALL coordinate dependencies and prevent conflicts
4. WHEN system load is high THEN agents SHALL queue tasks and process them in priority order
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging and user notification
