The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. AI systems are designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, including visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.`

Narrow AI is designed to perform a narrow task, such as facial recognition or internet searches. General AI would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level equal to human intelligence. Superintelligence refers to AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects.`,
